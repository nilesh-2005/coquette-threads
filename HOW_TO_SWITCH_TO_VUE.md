# How to Switch to Vue

The `frontend-vue` directory contains a scaffold for a Nuxt 3 application that mirrors the design of the React version.

## Usage

1.  Navigate to the directory:
    ```bash
    cd frontend-vue
    ```

2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  Run development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

## Feature Parity (TODO)
The current scaffold is basic. To match the React frontend, you will need to:
- Configure Tailwind CSS.
- Install GSAP.
- Recreate the components (HeroEditorial, ProductCard) using Vue/Nuxt syntax.
